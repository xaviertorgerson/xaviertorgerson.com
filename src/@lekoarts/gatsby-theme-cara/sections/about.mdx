## About

> I am a Pittsburgh-based developer focused on writing clean and efficent code that delivers value to its users.

An engineer at heart who loves building things even if that means powertools over code.
I was brought to software when I saw how it could empower my electronics projects.
But lately my love for software has surpased hardware and I working on Front-end web applications.
Aside from programming I enjoy traveling, and playing my furry best friend Apollo.
